Title: WETCAT Librarian - The First Library-Themed P2E Game with Real Token Rewards [No Investment Required]

Been playing this for a week and actually having fun while earning. Here's the deal:

**What:** Arcade game where you play a librarian catching book thieves
**Rewards:** 10-100 $WETCAT daily (currently ~$50-500)
**Cost:** Completely FREE to play
**Chain:** Base (low fees anyway, but uses Permit2 for gasless claims)

**Why it's different:**
- Actually fun gameplay (not another idle clicker)
- World ID integration prevents bot farming
- No NFT purchase required to earn
- Active development with weekly updates

**The twist:** If you verify with World ID (privacy-preserving), you get 2X rewards. Smart way to keep bots out while rewarding real players.

Game: wetcat.boomboxindustries.com/game
Contract: [Etherscan link]
Audit: [Audit report link]

DYOR but this is refreshing in the P2E space. Plus, who doesn't want to throw books at kids? 📚
