## Bug Fixes - Game Start Issues (2025-08-06)

### Fixed Critical Issues Preventing Game Start

1. **Property Name Mismatches**
   - Fixed `coin.isShelved` references to use correct `coin.isDeposited` property in PlayingState.js
   - This was causing undefined property errors when checking coin states

2. **Entity Collection References**
   - Fixed `state.shelves` to `state.wallets` in Coin.js collision detection
   - Fixed `state.shelves` to `state.wallets` in Scammer.js findNearestWallet method
   - Fixed `state.books` reference (removed) in Scammer.js dropAllCoins method

3. **Scammer Carried Items**
   - Fixed `scammer.carriedCoin` (singular) to `scammer.carriedCoins` (plural) array access
   - Updated coin snatching logic to check array length instead of undefined property
   - Removed undefined `dropCoinTimer` property reference

4. **Method Call Fixes**
   - Fixed `wallet.canAcceptCoin()` call to not require parameter in checkCoinDepositing
   - The method in Wallet.js expects a coin parameter, but logic was checking before having a coin

### Files Modified
- `/src/game/states/PlayingState.js` - Fixed property references and method calls
- `/src/game/entities/Coin.js` - Fixed state.shelves to state.wallets
- `/src/game/entities/Scammer.js` - Fixed state references and removed invalid book tracking

### Impact
These fixes resolve the issue where clicking "Start Game" would fail silently due to JavaScript errors during the PlayingState initialization and entity interactions.
